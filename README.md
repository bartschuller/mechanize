# Mechanize

Mechanize for Scala is a programmable web robot, useful for testing and scraping websites. It understands both the HTTP protocol and HTML, thanks to [Apache HttpClient](http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/) and [the Validator.nu HTML Parser](http://about.validator.nu/htmlparser/).

## Building

There are no prebuilt jars available at this time. To build it yourself you have to use [sbt](http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/) (highly recommended!)

    sbt update publish-local

and add the following dependency to your project:

    "org.smop" %% "mechanize" % "0.1-SNAPSHOT"
